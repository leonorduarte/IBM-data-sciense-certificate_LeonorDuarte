# Leonor Duarte - Portfolio
## About
Hi, I’m Leonor! I have a strong academic foundation in Management and Marketing Intelligence and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data-Driven Marketing. My passion lies in combining data analytics and strategic insights to solve real-world problems. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the fields of data science and project management as an entry-level data specialist and project leader.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex datasets and developed a knack for identifying patterns and actionable insights. I’ve also gained hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and workflow optimization, which I believe are key assets in supporting impactful decision-making. Certifications like the IBM Data Science Specialization and Scrum Master further complement my skills.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

In the **Course 10:** Applied Data Science Capstone, I explored data related to the first stage landings of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transportation company founded by Elon Musk, has revolutionized the industry by drastically reducing launch costs through innovative technology. By safely landing and reusing the Falcon 9’s first stage booster—responsible for 70% of the rocket's cost—SpaceX has managed to cut costs by more than 50% compared to competitors. The company aims to reduce costs by 99% with the completion of its Starship project, further solidifying its dominance in the space exploration market.
This capstone project focused on analyzing data from publicly available sources, including the SpaceX API and Wikipedia, to generate insights and predict the likelihood of successful first stage booster landings on drone ships. Using machine learning techniques, we sought to determine which model could best predict the outcome of these landings.

### Problem Statement
Safely landing the first stage booster is critical for SpaceX’s cost-saving strategy and market leadership. Reused boosters cost half as much as new ones, making their recovery and reuse essential to maintaining the company’s competitive edge. By analyzing launch data, this project aimed to answer:

What factors influence the success of a Falcon 9 first stage landing?
Which machine learning model performs best in predicting landing success?
Will a future Falcon 9 first stage landing be successful?

### Methodology
[Data Collection](https://github.com/leonorduarte/LeonorDuarte-IBM-data-sciense-certificate/blob/main/1Capstone_Leonor%20Duarte_Data_Collection.ipynb): Launch data was extracted using web scraping from Wikipedia and through the SpaceX API. 
[Data Wrangling](https://github.com/leonorduarte/LeonorDuarte-IBM-data-sciense-certificate/blob/main/3-Capstone_LeonorDuarte_Data_Wrangling%20(2).ipynb): Information about flight details, payload mass, orbit type, launch site, mission outcomes, and first stage landing success was processed to serve as the dependent variable for prediction models. 
Exploratory Analysis: [SQL queries](https://github.com/leonorduarte/LeonorDuarte-IBM-data-sciense-certificate/blob/main/4_Capstone_LeonorDuarte_EDA_SQL%20(2).ipynb),[static plots](https://github.com/leonorduarte/LeonorDuarte-IBM-data-sciense-certificate/blob/main/6_LeonorDuarte_Launch_Site_Location%20(1).ipynb),[interactive visualizations](https://github.com/leonorduarte/LeonorDuarte-IBM-data-sciense-certificate/blob/main/5_Capstone_LeonorDuarte_EDA_Data_Visualization%20(1).ipynb), and [dashboards](https://github.com/leonorduarte/LeonorDuarte-IBM-data-sciense-certificate/blob/main/7-App) were used to uncover patterns and trends in the data. 
Machine Learning: Predictive analysis was conducted using Logistic Regression, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree, and KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) models to assess accuracy and suitability.

### Results
The dataset provided insights into variables such as flight numbers, payload masses, and mission outcomes. The machine learning models Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN performed equally well on the dataset, showcasing their potential for predicting Falcon 9 landing success.
This project highlights how data-driven insights and predictive analytics can support SpaceX’s innovative approach to reducing launch costs and achieving sustainable space exploration.
